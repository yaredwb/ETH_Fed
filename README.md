# D3.js Interactive Map of ETH

This code builds an interactive map of Ethiopia using D3.js, showing the Level 1 (Regions) and Level 2 (Zones) administrative boundaries. The data was obtained from [GADM.org](https://gadm.org/). Level 3 (Woreda) boundaries will be added soon, hopefully. Link to interactive map: https://yaredwb.github.io/ETH_Fed/
